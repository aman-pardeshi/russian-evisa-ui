    <div>
      A Russia e-Visa is an electronic travel authorization that allows foreign
      citizens to visit specific regions in Russia, such as Kaliningrad, St.
      Petersburg, and the Far East, without the need for a traditional visa. It
      simplifies the process by allowing applicants to complete the entire
      process online, from submitting necessary documents like passport copies
      to receiving the visa, eliminating the need for a visit to a Russian
      embassy or consulate.

        Eligibility for Russian e-Visa
      </div>
      Not all countries are eligible for a Russian e-Visa, including the U.S.,
      Canada, and the U.K., due to political or diplomatic reasons. Eligibility
      depends on your nationality and the specific region of Russia you plan to
      visit. Some countries may qualify for all three types of e-Visas, while
      others may be eligible for only one or two. Itâ€™s crucial to check the
      specific eligibility criteria for your nationality before applying.
