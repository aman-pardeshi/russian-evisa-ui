            <p>
              The processing time for a Russian eVisa typically ranges from
              <b>[X] to [Y] business days.</b> This timeframe can vary depending
              on the type of visa you're applying for and the volume of
              applications being processed by the relevant authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
              We recommend applying at least [Z] days before your travel date to
              account for any unexpected delays. If you're in a rush, feel free
              to contact our team for expedited processing options.

              Once your application has been submitted to the relevant

              double-checking all your details before submitting the form.

              be able to intervene before it's fully processed.
